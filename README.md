## Synthetic Medical Data (SMD) Quality Library

A Python library for evaluating the quality of synthetic medical data (SMD) using the **7Cs framework** and for generating a comprehensive **SMD Card**. This library provides tools to compute quantitative metrics for dataset evaluation and document the results in a standardized card format.

---

## Features

### 7Cs Quality Evaluation
- Extract feature representation for quality quantification
- Compute metrics for:
  - **Congruence**: Measures the alignment between synthetic and real datasets to ensure structural, statistical, and visual similarity.
  - **Coverage**: Evaluates the diversity, representativeness, and novelty of the synthetic dataset. 
  - **Constraint**: Ensures that the synthetic data adheres to known constraints, which include clinical, imaging, geometric, or technical. 
  - **Completeness**: Checks whether synthetic data includes all necessary information (e.g., labels, metadata) required for its intended use.
  - **Compliance**: Assesses adherence to regulatory standards, fomrat, privacy, and institutional guidelines.
  - **Comprehension**: Evaluates the clarity and interpretability of the synthetic dataset's documentation.
  - **Consistency**: Ensures uniformity and stability of data quality across subgroups, batches, or time periods.

    
- Support for global and local quality assessments.

###  Library Metrics
The library contains a range of metrics summarized in the table below. Key attributes for each metric are described as follows:
- **Space**: Indicates the domain where the metric operates (e.g., embedding, metadata fields).
- **Binary**: Specifies whether the metric can be applied to synthetic data alone (unary) or requires comparison with patient data (binary).
- **Direction**: Describes the optimization goal (e.g., maximize, minimize, or statistical significance).
- **Image-Metric**: Indicates whether the metric is restricted to image or signal data or applicable to other types, such as clinical notes or numerical data.
- **Description**: Briefly explains what the metric evaluates and its relevance to SMD quality.

Note that the Direction of Coverage metrics should be maximized within a specific range to ensure synthetic medical data (SMD) is diverse while remaining valid and aligned with patient data.
