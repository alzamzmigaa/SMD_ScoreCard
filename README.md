## Overview

The **SMD ScoreCard** library provides a structured framework for evaluating the quality of synthetic medical datasets. Leveraging the **7Cs framework**, the library helps researchers and developers assess critical aspects of synthetic datasets, including correctness, coverage, constraints, and compliance. Additionally, it offers tools for feature extraction, quality quantification, and documentation, ensuring that datasets meet clinical, technical, and regulatory standards.

## Key Features

### Feature Extraction

The library includes a **Feature Extraction Module** to extract meaningful representations from data, including:

- **Token Embeddings**: Extract features from clinical notes or textual data to enable semantic analysis.
- **Imaging Features**: Extract spatial, intensity, or structural properties from medical images using radiomic or deep learning-based embeddings.
- **Feature Summarization**: Summarize high-dimensional feature spaces to compact representations using techniques like dimensionality reduction or statistical summarization.

---

### Quality Quantification

The second step involves **quantification based on the 7Cs framework**, which evaluates SMD across key quality dimensions:

1. **Congruence**: Measures alignment between synthetic and real data.
2. **Coverage**: Evaluates diversity, representativeness, and novelty.
3. **Constraint**: Ensures adherence to known constraints, including clinical, imaging, and technical.
4. **Completeness**: Assesses whether all necessary information (e.g., labels, metadata) is included.
5. **Compliance**: Verifies adherence to regulatory standards, privacy, and format guidelines.
6. **Comprehension**: Evaluates clarity and interpretability of accompanying documentation.
7. **Consistency**: Ensures uniformity of quality across subgroups, batches, or time periods.

###  Quantification Metrics
The library contains a range of metrics summarized in the table below. Key attributes for each metric are described as follows:
- **Space**: Indicates the domain where the metric operates (e.g., embedding, metadata fields).
- **Binary**: Specifies whether the metric can be applied to synthetic data alone (unary) or requires comparison with patient data (binary).
- **Direction**: Describes the optimization goal (e.g., maximize, minimize, or statistical significance).
- **Image-Metric**: Indicates whether the metric is restricted to image or signal data or applicable to other types, such as clinical notes or numerical data.
- **Description**: Briefly explains what the metric evaluates and its relevance to SMD quality.

Note that the Direction of Coverage metrics should be maximized within a specific range to ensure synthetic medical data (SMD) is diverse while remaining valid and aligned with patient data.
